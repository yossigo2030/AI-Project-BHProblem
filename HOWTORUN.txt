"aStar" runs regular aStar
"aStarT" runs timed aStar

"qLearnFast" runs Q-Learning fast algorithm 
gentic runs on genetic.py file, main has further instructions
any other argument-runs the game as a human controlled player
advanced:
change arguments in GameManager for diffrent effects
NODECOUNT how many nodes in A*
SAVETOFILE saves the frames to requirement folder
TESTWAVE changes wave configuration
